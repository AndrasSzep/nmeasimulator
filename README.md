# NMEASimulator

## NMEA data stream generator.

NMEASimulator is an NMEA data stream generator to mimic vessel movement, engine status, water depth, etc.

It can work in two modes:

1. Set initial seed values and then perodically apply a delta to them to mimic vessel movement

1. Follow a GPX Track. NMEASimulator will walk through each point of the Track at the interval set in the configuration screen.

*Note: If a track has multiple segments, NMEASimulator will concatenate all the segments into one contiguous Track*


_**NMEASimulator is a replacement for the NMEASimulator Chrome App** (Support for Chrome Apps end as of June 2020 for Windows, Mac & Linux)_
